  "description" : "This CodeSystem defines normalized codes for the **clinical context / relative timepoint** at which a stroke-related assessment is performed.\nIt is primarily used to contextualize instruments whose interpretation depends on phase (e.g., mRS/NIHSS at baseline vs discharge vs follow-up).\n\n**Primary use-case**\n- Use as the value in `ObservationTimingContextExtension.valueCodeableConcept` to label the phase of an assessment.\n\n**How it complements effective[x]**\n- `Observation.effective[x]` records the actual date/time (when known).\n- This CodeSystem records the standardized phase label used for reporting and comparability.\n\n**Why this is needed**\n- Many workflows report outcomes by phase even when the exact timestamp is unknown or operationally variable (“mRS at 90 days”).",
