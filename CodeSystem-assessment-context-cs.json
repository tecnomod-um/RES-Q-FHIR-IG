  "description" : "This CodeSystem defines normalized codes for the clinical context / relative timepoint at which a stroke-related assessment was performed. It is primarily used to contextualize functional and severity instruments (e.g., mRS and NIHSS) where interpretation depends on whether the score reflects baseline status, acute presentation, discharge status, or follow-up.\n\nThese codes represent *relative phases* (pre-stroke baseline, admission, discharge, ~3-month follow-up) rather than precise timestamps. The actual date/time of measurement should be recorded in Observation.effective[x] when known; the context code complements effective[x] by expressing the clinical phase, which is often necessary for reporting and comparability (e.g., “mRS pre-stroke” vs “mRS at discharge”).",
