  <description value="This CodeSystem defines codes for the modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia / modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) reperfusion grade. mTICI is an ordinal angiographic scale used to quantify the extent of antegrade reperfusion of the downstream ischemic territory after endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke (e.g., mechanical thrombectomy).&#xA;&#xA;The scale ranges from 0 (no perfusion) to 3 (complete reperfusion), with 2a/2b/2c subgrades to distinguish partial, substantial, and near-complete reperfusion. These codes are intended for consistent, interoperable capture in HL7® FHIR® resources—most commonly Observation.valueCodeableConcept—supporting procedural documentation, registry submission, audit/quality improvement, and research.&#xA;&#xA;Scope and modeling notes:&#xA;- This CodeSystem represents the *final* angiographic reperfusion grade for the target downstream territory, typically assigned from the final post-procedural angiographic run (commonly DSA).&#xA;- It does not encode target vessel location, imaging modality details, timestamps, technique/device, number of passes, collateral status, or adjudication process; those elements should be recorded separately (e.g., Procedure, ImagingStudy, Observation.method, extensions).&#xA;- Any local definition of “successful reperfusion” (often operationalized as mTICI ≥ 2b, depending on protocol) should be implemented via ValueSets, rules, or reporting logic without altering code meanings."/>
