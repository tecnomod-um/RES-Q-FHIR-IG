  "description" : " This CodeSystem defines coded circumstances related to stroke symptom onset that are clinically relevant for eligibility decisions, diagnostic reasoning, and reporting—particularly when the exact onset time is unknown or atypical.\n\nThese codes are intended to be used as Observation.code in the StrokeCircumstanceObservationProfile to assert that a given onset circumstance applies to the index stroke event. They do not encode the precise onset timestamp, last-known-well time, or location of onset; those details should be represented separately (e.g., dedicated Observations, Encounter/Condition attributes, or extensions).",
