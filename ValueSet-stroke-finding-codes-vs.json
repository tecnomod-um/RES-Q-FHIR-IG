  "description" : "This ValueSet aggregates a small set of coded “finding/assessment concepts” used by the SpecificFindingObservationProfile for stroke-related documentation. It currently includes:\n- specific disorder concepts relevant to stroke workup (from SpecificFindingCodesVS), and\n- the mTICI assessment concept code (from MTICICodeVS).\n\nImplementer note: This ValueSet is used to constrain Observation.code. Where Observation.code is a disorder concept (e.g., AF disorder), the Observation instance should be interpreted as capturing an *assessment about that finding* (with the assessment result carried in Observation.valueCodeableConcept, per profile constraints). Where Observation.code is an assessment concept (e.g., mTICI), the Observation.valueCodeableConcept carries the corresponding score/result.",
