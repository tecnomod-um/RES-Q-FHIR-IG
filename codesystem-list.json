      "description" : "This CodeSystem defines normalized codes for the clinical context / relative timepoint at which a stroke-related assessment was performed. It is primarily used to contextualize functional and severity instruments (e.g., mRS and NIHSS) where interpretation depends on whether the score reflects baseline status, acute presentation, discharge status, or follow-up.\n\nThese codes represent *relative phases* (pre-stroke baseline, admission, discharge, ~3-month follow-up) rather than precise timestamps. The actual date/time of measurement should be recorded in Observation.effective[x] when known; the context code complements effective[x] by expressing the clinical phase, which is often necessary for reporting and comparability (e.g., “mRS pre-stroke” vs “mRS at discharge”).\n\nScope note: This CodeSystem is intentionally small and focused on common stroke pathway milestones; implementers may extend it (with additional codes and governance) if other standardized follow-up timepoints are required (e.g., 6 months, 1 year)."

This supports standard reporting (e.g., “mRS at 90 days”), comparability across sites, and consistent downstream analytics.\n\nScope and modeling notes:\n- mRS is a coarse, global disability scale; it does not encode detailed domain-specific functional limitations (mobility, cognition, ADLs) which should be captured via additional instruments/Observations if required.\n- The CodeSystem defines only the *score*; method of ascertainment (in-person, telephone, structured interview) and assessor details should be captured separately when relevant."

These codes are intended for consistent, interoperable capture in HL7® FHIR® resources—most commonly Observation.valueCodeableConcept—supporting procedural documentation, registry submission, audit/quality improvement, and research.\n\nScope and modeling notes:\n- This CodeSystem represents the *final* angiographic reperfusion grade for the target downstream territory, typically assigned from the final post-procedural angiographic run (commonly DSA).\n- It does not encode target vessel location, imaging modality details, timestamps, technique/device, number of passes, collateral status, or adjudication process; those elements should be recorded separately (e.g., Procedure, ImagingStudy, Observation.method, extensions).\n- Any local definition of “successful reperfusion” (often operationalized as mTICI ≥ 2b, depending on protocol) should be implemented via ValueSets, rules, or reporting logic without altering code meanings."

The intent is to store the *measured interval* (a duration) in Observation.valueQuantity (UCUM minutes), while event timestamps (arrival time, needle time, groin puncture time) may be stored separately when available.\n\nImplementation note: Exact operational definitions can vary by institution (e.g., “needle time” as alteplase bolus vs infusion start; “door time” as ED arrival vs triage time). Implementers should align local measurement definitions and document them (e.g., in metadata, profiles, or implementation guidance) to ensure comparability across sites."
