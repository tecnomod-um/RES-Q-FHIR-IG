http://tecnomod-um.org/CodeSystem/assessment-context-cs,0.1.0,active,,AssessmentContextCS,Assessment Context Code System,"This CodeSystem defines normalized codes for the **clinical context / relative timepoint** at which a stroke-related assessment is performed. It is primarily used to contextualize instruments whose interpretation depends on phase (e.g., mRS/NIHSS at baseline vs discharge vs follow-up).  **Primary use-case** - Use as the value in `ObservationTimingContextExtension.valueCodeableConcept` to label the phase of an assessment.  **How it complements effective[x]** - `Observation.effective[x]` records the actual date/time (when known). - This CodeSystem records the standardized phase label used for reporting and comparability.  **Why this is needed** - Many workflows report outcomes by phase even when the exact timestamp is unknown or operationally variable (“mRS at 90 days”).","ValueSet/assessment-context-vs"

Scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe disability), with 6 indicating death.  **Primary use-case** - Use as the coded result in `Observation.valueCodeableConcept` (bound via MRsScoreVS) when recording an mRS outcome.  **Modeling notes** - mRS is a global disability scale and does not capture domain-specific limitations (mobility, ADLs, cognition).   Capture those via additional instruments/Observations when needed. - Method of ascertainment and assessor details should be recorded separately (e.g., Observation.method, performer, Provenance).","ValueSet/mrs-score-vs"
