It is primarily used to contextualize functional and severity instruments (e.g., mRS and NIHSS) where interpretation depends on whether the score reflects baseline status, acute presentation, discharge status, or follow-up.\n\nThese codes represent *relative phases* (pre-stroke baseline, admission, discharge, ~3-month follow-up) rather than precise timestamps. The actual date/time of measurement should be recorded in Observation.effective[x] when known; the context code complements effective[x] by expressing the clinical phase, which is often necessary for reporting and comparability (e.g., “mRS pre-stroke” vs “mRS at discharge”).\n\nScope note: This CodeSystem is intentionally small and focused on common stroke pathway milestones; implementers may extend it (with additional codes and governance) if other standardized follow-up timepoints are required (e.g., 6 months, 1 year).",
