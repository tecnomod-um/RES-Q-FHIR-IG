http://tecnomod-um.org/ValueSet/afib-flutter-status-vs,0.1.0,active,,AfibFlutterStatusVS,Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Status ValueSet,"This ValueSet constrains the allowed coded outcomes for documenting the status of an atrial fibrillation (AF) / atrial flutter assessment within the stroke workflow. It is intentionally limited to SNOMED CT qualifier values that express the epistemic status of the finding: (1) known present, (2) known absent, or (3) unknown.  The ValueSet is designed to support harmonized recording across systems when AF/flutter materially influences ischemic stroke etiology workup, thromboembolic risk stratification, and downstream management decisions (e.g., anticoagulation). It is appropriate for use as Observation.valueCodeableConcept to represent the result of screening, monitoring, or review of prior documentation.  Scope and modeling notes: - The qualifier values do not encode the rhythm subtype, chronicity, burden, or method of detection (e.g., ECG vs telemetry); those aspects should be represented using additional elements (e.g., Observation.method, device data) or separate Observations/Conditions as appropriate. - The ValueSet represents “status of assessment” rather than the disorder concept itself; if the clinical intent is to assert a diagnosis of AF/flutter, use a Condition resource with an appropriate SNOMED CT disorder code instead of (or in addition to) this status.",,"SCT"

It is intended to be bound to Observation.code in the FunctionalScoreObservationProfile. Downstream validation/invariants then enforce the appropriate datatype of Observation.value[x]: - mRS is captured as a coded ordinal category (valueCodeableConcept bound to MRsScoreVS). - NIHSS is captured as a numeric total score (valueInteger), representing the summed NIHSS total rather than item-level subscores.",,"SCT"

It is intended to be paired with a binding of Observation.valueCodeableConcept to MticiScoreVS.

These codes are suitable when the intent is to reference the disorder concepts themselves (e.g., as a focus finding or a coded problem). When the intent is to capture the *status of an assessment* (present/absent/unknown) rather than assert a diagnosis, implementers should use an Observation with a dedicated assessment concept as Observation.code and bind Observation.valueCodeableConcept to an appropriate status ValueSet (e.g., AfibFlutterStatusVS).",,"SCT"
